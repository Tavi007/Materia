Welcome to the Elemental Combat repository.

Goal of this mod is to enhance the combat system by adding elemental and style properties to combat. This means, that players, mobs and items all have new attack and defense properties. Upon hitting something, these properties will be checked and a new damage value will be calculated.

I made this mod, because I noticed, that in a lot of modpacks you end up using the same weapon. With this mod I hope there is an incentiv to switch your weapon and armor depending on the monster you are about to fight.

This mod is mostly an API for other modders and to a certain extend for packmakers too.

If you want more details on this (aka what one can do with it) please watch this Video:
comming soon (tm)

Best regards, Tavi007.

 

PS: I do not plan on backporting it. Mostly because 1.16 introduced the ProjectileEntity-class, which is a parent class for ArrowProjectile/FireBallProjectile and so. In 1.15 and earlier this didn't exist and I would have to rewrite quite a lot of code.
